In this project The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. 
Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working.
They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.
First i draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. 
This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation
Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO,
you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario.
Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of chart as illustrated in the dashboard file
but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.
